"Sleep Quality and Aging: A Systematic Review on Healthy Older People, Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease.",2022 Jul 11;19(14):8457.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35886309/,"Aging is characterized by changes in the structure and quality of sleep. When the alterations in sleep become substantial, they can generate or accelerate cognitive decline, even in the absence of overt pathology. In fact, impaired sleep represents one of the earliest symptoms of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This systematic review aimed to analyze the studies on sleep quality in aging, also considering mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD. The review process was conducted according to the PRISMA statement. A total of 71 studies were included, and the whole sample had a mean age that ranged from 58.3 to 93.7 years (62.8-93.7 healthy participants and 61.8-86.7 pathological populations). Of these selected studies, 33 adopt subjective measurements, 31 adopt objective measures, and 10 studies used both. Pathological aging showed a worse impoverishment of sleep than older adults, in both subjective and objective measurements. The most common aspect compromised in AD and MCI were REM sleep, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and sleep duration. These results underline that sleep alterations are associated with cognitive impairment. In conclusion, the frequency and severity of sleep disturbance appear to follow the evolution of cognitive impairment. The overall results of objective measures seem more consistent than those highlighted by subjective measurements.",Alzheimer; aging; healthy elderly; mild cognitive impairment; older; sleep quality.,"Maria Casagrande, 1, Giuseppe Forte, 1, 2, Francesca Favieri, 2, 3, Ilaria Corbo, 3","1 Department of Dynamic and Clinical Psychology and Health Studies, Sapienza University of Rome, 00185 Roma, Italy.; 2 Body and Action Laboratory, IRCCS Santa Lucia Foundation, Via Ardeatina 306, 00179 Rome, Italy.; 3 Department of Psychology, Sapienza University of Rome, Via dei Marsi 78, 00185 Roma, Italy."
Pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions to enhance sleep in mild cognitive impairment and mild Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review.,2021 Aug;30(4):e13229.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33289311/,"Suboptimal sleep causes cognitive decline and probably accelerates Alzheimer's Disease (AD) progression. Several sleep interventions have been tested in established AD dementia cases. However early intervention is needed in the course of AD at Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) or mild dementia stages to help prevent decline and maintain good quality of life. This systematic review aims to summarize evidence on sleep interventions in MCI and mild AD dementia. Seven databases were systematically searched for interventional studies where ≥ 75% of participants met diagnostic criteria for MCI/mild AD dementia, with a control group and validated sleep outcome measures. Studies with a majority of participants diagnosed with Moderate to Severe AD were excluded. After removal of duplicates, 22,133 references were returned in two separate searches (August 2019 and September 2020). 325 full papers were reviewed with 18 retained. Included papers reported 16 separate studies, total sample (n = 1,056), mean age 73.5 years. 13 interventions were represented: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy - Insomnia (CBT-I), A Multi-Component Group Based Therapy, A Structured Limbs Exercise Programme, Aromatherapy, Phase Locked Loop Acoustic Stimulation, Transcranial Stimulation, Suvorexant, Melatonin, Donepezil, Galantamine, Rivastigmine, Tetrahydroaminoacridine and Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP). Psychotherapeutic approaches utilising adapted CBT-I and a Structured Limbs Exercise Programme each achieved statistically significant improvements in the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index with one study reporting co-existent improved actigraphy variables. Suvorexant significantly increased Total Sleep Time and Sleep Efficiency whilst reducing Wake After Sleep Onset time. Transcranial Stimulation enhanced cortical slow oscillations and spindle power during daytime naps. Melatonin significantly reduced sleep latency in two small studies and sleep to wakefulness transitions in a small sample. CPAP demonstrated efficacy in participants with Obstructive Sleep Apnoea. Evidence to support other interventions was limited. Whilst new evidence is emerging, there remains a paucity of evidence for sleep interventions in MCI and mild AD highlighting a pressing need for high quality experimental studies exploring alternative sleep interventions.",AD; Alzheimer's dementia; Alzheimer's disease; MCI; mild cognitive impairment; sleep.,"Jonathan Blackman, 1, 2, Marta Swirski, 1, James Clynes, 3, Sam Harding, 1, Yue Leng, 4, Elizabeth Coulthard, 2","1 North Bristol NHS Trust, Bristol, UK.; 2 Bristol Medical School, University of Bristol, Bristol, UK.; 3 University of Bath, Bath, UK.; 4 Department of Psychiatry, University of California, San Francisco, CA, USA."
Implications of sleep disturbance and inflammation for Alzheimer's disease dementia.,2019 Mar;18(3):296-306.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30661858/,"Nearly half of all adults older than 60 years of age report sleep disturbance, as characterised either by reports of insomnia complaints with daytime consequences, dissatisfaction with sleep quality or quantity, or the diagnosis of insomnia disorder. Accumulating evidence shows that sleep disturbance contributes to cognitive decline and might also increase the risk of Alzheimer's disease dementia by increasing β-amyloid burden. That sleep disturbance would be a candidate risk factor for Alzheimer's disease might seem surprising, given that disturbed sleep is usually considered a consequence of Alzheimer's disease. However, a bidirectional relationship between sleep and Alzheimer's disease is supported by advances in our understanding of sleep disturbance-induced increases in systemic inflammation, which can be viewed as an early event in the course of Alzheimer's disease. Inflammation increases β-amyloid burden and is thought to drive Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis. Improved understanding of the mechanisms linking sleep disturbance and Alzheimer's disease risk could facilitate the identification of targets for prevention, given that both sleep disturbance and inflammatory activation might be modifiable risk factors for Alzheimer's disease.",Mots-clés non disponibles,"Michael R Irwin, 1, Michael V Vitiello, 2","1 Cousins Center for Psychoneuroimmunology, Jane and Terry Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior, Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences, David Geffen School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, USA.

Micro-architectural sleep alterations, nocturnal sleep fragmentation, decrease in nocturnal sleep duration, diurnal napping and even inversion of the sleep-wake cycle are the main disorders observed in patients with AD. Experimental and epidemiological evidence for a close reciprocal interaction between cognitive decline and sleep alterations is growing. Management of sleep disorders in AD is pre-eminently behavioral. Association of melatonin and bright light treatment seems to be promising as well.

"Sleep, Cognitive impairment, and Alzheimer's disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",2017 Jan 1;40(1).,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28364458/,"Study objectives:
        
      
      Mounting evidence implicates disturbed sleep or lack of sleep as one of the risk factors for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but the extent of the risk is uncertain. We conducted a broad systematic review and meta-analysis to quantify the effect of sleep problems/disorders on cognitive impairment and AD. Methods:
        
      
      Original published literature assessing any association of sleep problems or disorders with cognitive impairment or AD was identified by searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane library. Effect estimates of individual studies were pooled and relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated using random effects models. We also estimated the population attributable risk. Results:
        
      
      Twenty-seven observational studies (n = 69216 participants) that provided 52 RR estimates were included in the meta-analysis. Individuals with sleep problems had a 1.55 (95% CI: 1.25-1.93), 1.65 (95% CI: 1.45-1.86), and 3.78 (95% CI: 2.27-6.30) times higher risk of AD, cognitive impairment, and preclinical AD than individuals without sleep problems, respectively. The overall meta-analysis revealed that individuals with sleep problems had a 1.68 (95% CI: 1.51-1.87) times higher risk for the combined outcome of cognitive impairment and/or AD. Approximately 15% of AD in the population may be attributed to sleep problems. Conclusion:
        
      
      This meta-analysis confirmed the association between sleep and cognitive impairment or AD and, for the first time, consolidated the evidence to provide an ""average"" magnitude of effect. As sleep problems are of a growing concern in the population, these findings are of interest for potential prevention of AD.",Alzheimer’s disease; cognitive decline; dementia.; sleep disorders; sleep parameters; sleep problems.,"Omonigho M Bubu, 1, Michael Brannick, 2, James Mortimer, 1, Ogie Umasabor-Bubu, 1, Yuri V Sebastião, 1, Yi Wen, 3, Skai Schwartz, 1, Amy R Borenstein, 1, Yougui Wu, 1, David Morgan, 4, 5, William M Anderson, 6","1 Department of Epidemiology & Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.; 2 Psychology Department, College of Arts and Sciences, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.; 3 Department of Chemical and Biomedical Engineering, College of Engineering, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.; 4 Molecular Pharmacology and Physiology, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL.; 5 Byrd Alzheimer Institute, Tampa, FL.; 6 Sleep Medicine and Internal Medicine, Morsani College of Medicine, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL."

"Sleep Disturbance, Cognitive Decline, and Dementia: A Review.",2017 Aug;37(4):395-406.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28837986/,"Approximately half of older people report sleep disturbances, which are associated with various health conditions, including neurodegenerative disease and dementia. Indeed, 60 to 70% of people with cognitive impairment or dementia have sleep disturbances, which are linked to poorer disease prognosis. Sleep disturbances in people with dementia have long been recognized and studied; however, in the past 10 years, researchers have begun to study disturbed sleep, including sleep fragmentation, abnormal sleep duration, and sleep disorders, as risk factors for dementia. In this review the authors summarize evidence linking sleep disturbance and dementia. They describe how specific aspects of sleep (e.g., quality, duration) and the prevalence of clinical sleep disorders (e.g., sleep-disordered breathing, rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder) change with age; how sleep parameters and sleep disorders are associated with the risk of dementia; how sleep can be disturbed in dementia; and how disturbed sleep affects dementia prognosis. These findings highlight the potential importance of identifying and treating sleep problems and disorders in middle-aged and older adults as a strategy to prevent cognitive decline and dementia.

Rationale for a Multi-Factorial Approach for the Reversal of Cognitive Decline in Alzheimer's Disease and MCI: A Review.,2023 Jan 14;24(2):1659.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36675177/,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a multifactorial, progressive, neurodegenerative disease typically characterized by memory loss, personality changes, and a decline in overall cognitive function. Usually manifesting in individuals over the age of 60, this is the most prevalent type of dementia and remains the fifth leading cause of death among Americans aged 65 and older. While the development of effective treatment and prevention for AD is a major healthcare goal, unfortunately, therapeutic approaches to date have yet to find a treatment plan that produces long-term cognitive improvement. Drugs that may be able to slow down the progression rate of AD are being introduced to the market; however, there has been no previous solution for preventing or reversing the disease-associated cognitive decline. Recent studies have identified several factors that contribute to the progression and severity of the disease: diet, lifestyle, stress, sleep, nutrient deficiencies, mental health, socialization, and toxins. Thus, increasing evidence supports dietary and other lifestyle changes as potentially effective ways to prevent, slow, or reverse AD progression. Studies also have demonstrated that a personalized, multi-therapeutic approach is needed to improve metabolic abnormalities and AD-associated cognitive decline. These studies suggest the effects of abnormalities, such as insulin resistance, chronic inflammation, hypovitaminosis D, hormonal deficiencies, and hyperhomocysteinemia, in the AD process. Therefore a personalized, multi-therapeutic program based on an individual's genetics and biochemistry may be preferable over a single-drug/mono-therapeutic approach. This article reviews these multi-therapeutic strategies that identify and attenuate all the risk factors specific to each affected individual. This article systematically reviews studies that have incorporated multiple strategies that target numerous factors simultaneously to reverse or treat cognitive decline. We included high-quality clinical trials and observational studies that focused on the cognitive effects of programs comprising lifestyle, physical, and mental activity, as well as nutritional aspects. Articles from PubMed Central, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases were collected, and abstracts were reviewed for relevance to the subject matter. Epidemiological, pathological, toxicological, genetic, and biochemical studies have all concluded that AD represents a complex network insufficiency. The research studies explored in this manuscript confirm the need for a multifactorial approach to target the various risk factors of AD. A single-drug approach may delay the progression of memory loss but, to date, has not prevented or reversed it. Diet, physical activity, sleep, stress, and environment all contribute to the progression of the disease, and, therefore, a multi-factorial optimization of network support and function offers a rational therapeutic strategy. Thus, a multi-therapeutic program that simultaneously targets multiple factors underlying the AD network may be more effective than a mono-therapeutic approach.",AD risk factors; Alzheimer’s disease; brain stimulation; cognitive decline; diet; exercise; herbs; multi-therapeutic program; neurodegeneration; sleep; stress; supplements; therapeutics.,"Rammohan V Rao, 1, Kaavya G Subramaniam, 2, Julie Gregory, 1, Aida L Bredesen, 1, Christine Coward, 1, Sho Okada, 1, Lance Kelly, 1, Dale E Bredesen, 1, 3","1 Apollo Health, Burlingame, CA 94011, USA.; 2 Department of Psychology, University of California, Davis, CA 95616, USA.; 3 Department of Molecular and Medical Pharmacology, University of California, Los Angeles, CA 90024, USA."
"Obstructive sleep apnea, cognition and Alzheimer's disease: A systematic review integrating three decades of multidisciplinary research.",2020 Apr:50:101250.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31881487/,"Increasing evidence links cognitive-decline and Alzheimer's disease (AD) to various sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). With increasing age, there are substantial differences in OSA's prevalence, associated comorbidities and phenotypic presentation. An important question for sleep and AD researchers is whether OSA's heterogeneity results in varying cognitive-outcomes in older-adults compared to middle-aged adults. In this review, we systematically integrated research examining OSA and cognition, mild cognitive-impairment (MCI) and AD/AD biomarkers; including the effects of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment, particularly focusing on characterizing the heterogeneity of OSA and its cognitive-outcomes. Broadly, in middle-aged adults, OSA is often associated with mild impairment in attention, memory and executive function. In older-adults, OSA is not associated with any particular pattern of cognitive-impairment at cross-section; however, OSA is associated with the development of MCI or AD with symptomatic patients who have a higher likelihood of associated disturbed sleep/cognitive-impairment driving these findings. CPAP treatment may be effective in improving cognition in OSA patients with AD. Recent trends demonstrate links between OSA and AD-biomarkers of neurodegeneration across all age-groups. These distinct patterns provide the foundation for envisioning better characterization of OSA and the need for more sensitive/novel sleep-dependent cognitive assessments to assess OSA-related cognitive-impairment.",Alzheimer's disease; Amyloid; Biomarkers; Cognition; Middle aged; Mild cognitive impairment; Obstructive sleep apnea; Older adults; Phosphorylated tau.,"Omonigho M Bubu, 1, Andreia G Andrade, 2, Ogie Q Umasabor-Bubu, 3, Megan M Hogan, 4, Arlener D Turner, 5, Mony J de Leon, 6, Gbenga Ogedegbe, 7, Indu Ayappa, 8, Girardin Jean-Louis G, 9, Melinda L Jackson, 10, Andrew W Varga, 8, Ricardo S Osorio, 11","1 Center for Brain Health, Department of Psychiatry, NYU Langone Medical Center, New York, NY, USA; Department of Population Health, New York University School of Medicine, Center for Healthful Behavior Change, New York, USA; Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, College of Public Health, University of South Florida, Tampa, FL, USA; Department of Applied Health Sciences, Wheaton College, Wheaton, IL, USA.

Sleep in Alzheimer's disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis of polysomnographic findings.,2022 Apr 1;12(1):136.,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35365609/,"Polysomnography (PSG) studies of sleep changes in Alzheimer's disease (AD) have reported but not fully established the relationship between sleep disturbances and AD. To better detail this relationship, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of reported PSG differences between AD patients and healthy controls. An electronic literature search was conducted in EMBASE, MEDLINE, All EBM databases, CINAHL, and PsycINFO inception to Mar 2021. Twenty-eight studies were identified for systematic review, 24 of which were used for meta-analysis. Meta-analyses revealed significant reductions in total sleep time, sleep efficiency, and percentage of slow-wave sleep (SWS) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and increases in sleep latency, wake time after sleep onset, number of awakenings, and REM latency in AD compared to controls. Importantly, both decreased SWS and REM were significantly associated with the severity of cognitive impairment in AD patients. Alterations in electroencephalogram (EEG) frequency components and sleep spindles were also observed in AD, although the supporting evidence for these changes was limited. Sleep in AD is compromised with increased measures of wake and decreased TST, SWS, and REM sleep relative to controls. AD-related reductions in SWS and REM sleep correlate with the degree of cognitive impairment. Alterations in sleep EEG frequency components such as sleep spindles may be possible biomarkers with relevance for diagnosing AD although their sensitivity and specificity remain to be clearly delineated.
